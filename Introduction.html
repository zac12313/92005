<p>Story summary
Understanding kaitiakitanga
Kaitiakitanga means guardianship and protection. It is a way of managing the environment, based on the Maori world view.
<br>
A kaitiaki is a guardian. This can be a person or group that cares for an area such as a lake or forest. They are given that role by the local iwi.
<br>
Maori world view
In the Maori world view, people are closely connected to the land and nature. Kaitiakitanga is based on this idea of humans as part of the natural world.
<br>
Traditional practices
In the past, people followed traditional practices when they were hunting, fishing, growing or finding food. These helped them to care for the environment.
<br>
They included:
<br>
temporary bans (rahui) on taking food from an area
using the lunar calendar (maramataka) to decide when to plant and harvest
taking only what was needed
hunting and fishing only for food, not as sport
using bird snares at the right time  for example, not when the birds were breeding.
Mana, tapu and mauri
Mana means spiritual power. If a forest has mana, it will have plenty of flowers, fruit and birds.
<br>
Tapu can mean spiritual restriction. Sometimes rahui (restrictions) are needed to help the mana of the forest. A rahui might stop people taking birds, fish or fruit from a certain area, or at a certain time.
<br>
Mauri means life force. This must be protected in forests, rivers, gardens, lakes and the sea. Special mauri stones, which tohunga (priests) said prayers over, were used to preserve this force.
<br>
Kaitiakitanga today
Today there is growing interest in kaitiakitanga. Iwi are restoring their environment and culture, and using traditional ideas in the modern world.
<br>
Ngai Tahu are guardians of pounamu (greenstone) in the South Island.
Te Ati Awa ki Taranaki made a claim to the government to stop pollution in their fishing areas.
Four iwi (Ngati Kahungunu, Rangitane, Muaupoko and Ngati Raukawa) have come together to stop the Manawatu River being polluted.

Kaitiakitanga has also been included in some laws, such as the Resource Management Act 1991.</p>
