        <td>Overproduction of Plastic. Plastic is cheap and versatile, so they produce it in massive amounts to package items, bottles, bags, toys, and a whole lot more. Much of it is single use, so it gets discarded.</td>
        <td>Poor Disposal. Many people litter or just don't properly dispose of plastic.</td>
        <td>Insufficient Recycling Systems Not all plastic can be recycled. Even plastics that are recyclable don't usually get recycled due to inadequate infrastructure or because of mis-sorting.</td>

        <td>Disposable Culture. We have gotten used to convenience-oriented consumption: plastic packaging, straws, bags, containers.</td>
        <td>Factory and Commercial Waste. Factories and ships primarily release plastic waste directly into waterways, often illegally.</td>
        <td>Microplastics from road, clothing, and artificial turf microplastics make it into waterways too.</td>
